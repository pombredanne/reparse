These examples shows a very basic Reparse setup to help you get started.
Under each directory there are files like this::

    expressions.yaml -- Contains the regular expression building blocks
    patterns.yaml    -- Contains the regular expression "glue"
    functions.py     -- Contains the instructions for building the output
    <example>.py     -- Contains the setup and use of the parser
