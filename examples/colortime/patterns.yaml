# Patterns: weave the regex expression groups together

BasicColorTime:
  # Order: If you have multiple patterns, you can use this field to 'weight' them
  # For example, if you have 3 matching patterns, the most complex one
  # Is the one you probably want, so put the highest number in Order: on that one.
  Order: 1

  # Pattern: Also a regular expression
  # Angle brackets tag such as <Class> contains the Expression class you want there
  # Each class contains one or more groups |ed together.
  Pattern: |
    <Color> (?: \s? at \s? )? <Time>

  # Note: You can use patterns in other patterns such as:
  # Pattern: <BasicColorTime>!+?
  # Function: Excited Color Time

OnlyColor:
  # This tests a pattern with only one expression
  Order: 2
  Pattern: |
    Crazy \s 2pm \s <Color>
